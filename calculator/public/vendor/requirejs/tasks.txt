Release Notes
-------------------


Next release
--------------

Docs:
- Pointer to motivations behind current thing, reason for dependencies.

- Update the coffeescript plugin to use the writeFile API?

- jjb's diagnostic/debug branch with dependency mappings

- https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/104: define as a special dependency?

- mingw on windows build: weird path issue/file not found? Tim's example.


- domReady plugin
  - Update docs
    - remove the config.ready support.
    - remove require.ready
    - add domReady docs.
  - add domReady tests? Or tested already in the tests.
    - Need waitForLoader test
    - Need to add a boolean to indicate if if scripts are done.
  - require.s.isDone used in Node and Rhino adapters?

- check priority tests on Safari 3, in the non-domReady branch.
  In master, it has occasional failures too.

- replacement for modify that intercepts callbacks, holds off until another module loads them?
  - A way to show dependency graph too?
- Minify the require.js files with UglifyJS.

- Test DOMContentLoaded work related to dojo-contributors "bring back skipIeDomLoaded" thread,
  selenium tests.
  - http://trac.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/13113

- https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/pull/71: process by 2/21

- r.js: do not find require calls inside define calls, to allow dynamic loading to
  happen without var req = require gymnastics.

- If any other info: IE checkLoaded recursion? https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/82

- build tool to rename require and define calls to other names?
- Confirm: From Richard Backhouse: As an FYI I have been doing my own investigation of using UglifyJS for compression
and one thing I found when trying to compress dojo 1.5 code was that I had ensure that "make_seqs"
flag was set to false when calling ast_squeeze. If I left this flag set to true the code would not load.

- https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/issues/1
  Why can't plugins have dependencies? It is because the dependency is not fully evaluated.
  Maybe rethink it, there have been some cases where creating a plugin that uses the
  text plugin would be useful. However, would that mean the optimized result would include
  the string twice in the output? Well for the text plugin, could allow other plugins to
  indicate "do not inline this dependency" to help with that.
- localeList for i18n.js support, for better Dojo support.


Bugs to work on
------------------


- File bug for UglifyJS on dead code removal.

- Update AMD page to mention require scanning means only do them at the top.

- Consider patches in jetpack for:
  - removing scanning
  - add amd object
  - add plugins?

- Allow specifying the use of a plugin in the data-main property? gets weird for built cases.

- building with packages.build.js, the alpha/replace path mapping does not work out?

- build's name insertion if there is comment between define( and the [dependencies]

- ending slash in paths should throw error: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/issue/49/

- Document new closure compiler options from neonstalwart
- require.modify alternative syntax/patch.
- has.js plugins
- require.def patch: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/pull/50

- Visualization of dependencies, highlighting circular dependencies: RobbertAtWork

- email on jsonp removal, toUrl and package names.

- Nested package config: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/pull/28

- IE, on errors, hits script onload, but need to make sure it is treated as a failure?

- https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues#issue/26:
  spider: throw with isCheckLoaded: maybe pass for refactor branch?

https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/issue/9
- Optimizer cannot include order! plugins in a build at the moment.

Optimizer improvements:
2) Investigate the issue with main.js baseUrl overriding the one in app.build.js
4) See if the pathing can be made simpler (abde's comment).

- Figure out if isCheckLoaded can be avoided. Not likely, but revisit.

- Finish PS3 work, investigate test failures, document level of support.

- Check out blackberry emulators at:
https://www.blackberry.com/Downloads/entry.do?code=060AD92489947D410D897474079C1477

- Building a lib that has its own lookup paths, so it can be self-contained?
  but what if want to share code? Maybe just make it an option, you can do it,
  but lose out on shared common.

- For function(require, exports, module) form, do not pass exports if the function
  does not ask  for it, to allow the function to set the exported value by returning.

- Figure out why priorityOrder test does not work, and if it should be supported.
  Loading a plugin while waiting for a priority load may not be worth supporting,
  it also means it will be slower. A priority module can include plugins but just
  use a plugin to load the priorit module.

- DOH updates
  - get latest code
  - fix rendering in IE 9 standards? How to get it to render in IE9 standard mode?

- Allow module names that match Object.prototype method names?
- browser test for loading css?

- Best practices/architecture guide

- consider removing require.isBrowser and require.s.isBrowser, check the tests, and send email to list first.

- Make sure text plugin works offline.
- Get Blackberry simulator. Blackberry greater than 4.6, and particulary with the Blackberry 9500 simulator (with OS v4.7),
install and launch Blackberry MDS service simulator before running simulator to get network.

- trying to find path of the file executed, as given to rhino:
http://groups.google.com/group/jsdoc-2/msg/b1dd2f8991156fa0

- with appName, and no native require, setting path to be outside the baseUrl meant that the require path was really
  relative to the output folder name?

- Use JSDoc to document a full module?

- When doing docs via jsdoc, using {some/module} as return types? How does JSDoc deal with the nested objects?
  Probably needs custom work to get it recognize the module concept thing.

- To validate with Caja: http://caja.appspot.com/ and paste the code inside a script tag.
