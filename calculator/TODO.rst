#. New terms covering term, half-term, and following holiday

This is basically the baby room terms but for 3-5 years.

Funding details are taken from the term that it covers. There are
subtleties with funding because it is not currently possible to
express which weeks in a term are fundable, so the naive solution has
the possibility of over-funding (because it assumes that every week is
fundable).


# Funding for two-year-olds

There is now funding for 2-year olds in addition to 3-5. It possibly
works differently though; we need details!


#. Payment references

Payment section should explicitly state the payment reference for
every expected payment. The reference string is a function of child
name, term, and the number of the reference (if multiple payments are
to be made, e.g. monthly).


#. Implement appliesToMeals

Further email:

> Also could you please make it so that no discount is
> applied to meals please?

Terms have been annotated with an appliesToMeals property but this is
currently ignored


#. Update fees for Autumn Term 2015-16 onwards

Ensure that:

> A full day between the hours of 08.00-18.00 will cost just £67.20
> when attending for three full days or more. When taking two full
> days per week it will be £76.80 per day.

Also ensure that:

> Meals in the baby room will continue to be free of charge but for
> children aged 2 - 5 the price will be £3.00 per meal.


#. lunch/dinner charges
#. payment dates monthly
#. Garamond webfont?  Legal?
#. Want your invoice?  Just print this page!
#. Vertical alignments.
#. Line up big table cols with float grid
#. Gaynor: read through FEEE funding; ensure terminology used is consistent with ours
#. Cleaner way to stop fade-out on load
#. Headcount dates can be removed so that if we create an invoice after the HC date, then it will allow funding to be shown without us having to manually adjust this each time. TODO this requires discussion
#. Funding should not be shown as a monetary value with top-up fees. Gaynor has a template of an invoice which conforms; our invoices should follow this.
